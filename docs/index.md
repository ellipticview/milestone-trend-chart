What is a Milestone Trend Chart?
============

An example
============

Getting Started
===============
Download the spreadsheet [here](https://ellipticview.github.io/milestone-trend-chart/assets/trendchart.xlsm).

The data is in an Excel table. If you required more columns/rows, then expand the table. Do not add adjacent columns or rows.

Fill out the milestones and press the button.

If you want to share the diagram, you can share the URL. As the URL is quite long, you might want to create a shorter version using [TinyUrl](https://tinyurl.com/).

How does it work?
============
When you click the button in the spreadsheet, a spreadsheet macro assembles the milestone information and invokes a web page from the server.

Your browser receives the web page and the milestone data. The browser then draws the chart using your milestone data. Your data is not used or stored on the server.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

### Does the website store my project information?
None of your data is stored by this web site. No user account or login is required. Your spreadsheet requests a web page, and all processing of your milestones is performed in your browser.

### Can I use a different date format in the spreadsheet?
Format the dates in the spreadsheet as you like.

### Can I use a different date format in the chart?
Not yet.

### When saving my spreadsheet I get this message: "Be careful! Parts of your document may include personal information that can't be removed by the Document Inspector."
